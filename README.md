# gitMessage

Have you ever thought, “Wow I wish I could turn my git repo into a messaging server”? How about I need more commits in my repo? Have you ever had a desire to have a very slow online chat with no security whatsoever? 
If the answer to any of these questions was a ‘yes’ then congratulations gitMessage is for you!
gitMessage can turn any regular git repo into a fun chat server for you and all your ```cool coding friends```. 
## How does it work?
gitMessage contains two files ```client.py``` this is a client that a user uses to communicate with a messaging server i.e. a git repo. And there is a ```chat.txt``` file that has to live in the root directory of a repository.
## Server Setup
All you got to do is plop a ```chat.txt``` file into the root directory of your repo, then invite members that you want to chat with to the repo. Congratulations you have finished your setup. 
## Using the Client 
Start the client ```python client.py```.  <br>
Enter the path to the server / repo, for example ```hsamuelson/gitMessage```.
Congrats you should be connected you or your friends server! You can now send messages. Be patient as messages do send slowly 😊! And remember lets keep the chats PG!

~ If it isn’t clear this is all a joke… but it does work.
